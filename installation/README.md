Add ATK.exe file to admin directory and run script.nsi using nullsoft nsis.

Latest NSIS version can be downloaded from [here](https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Download)

Compiling the script will make an ATK-installer.exe file.

If you have a ATK.exe compiled in ..\Release directory, running ..\quick.refresh.bat will create the installer and run it.
