ALL THE DATA VISIBLE HERE, WILL BE CRYPTED.

MULTIPLE BLOCKS ARE FOR DIRECTORIES

THE PROGRAM TAKES THE RAW DATA OF THE FILE, 
CRYPTS IT, AND PUTS IT BEHIND A PASSWORD.
AFTER UNLOCKING IT CHANGES DATA BACK TO NORMAL
STATE AND CHANGES THE FILE EXTENSION BACK TO ITS
ORIGINAL FORM. (MAY LEAD TO DATA CORRUPTION D=; )

    2. FILENAME filename
    3. LOCATION ON PATH c:\tmp
    4. HASHED PASSWORD hash

}   [] - BRACKETS ARE FOR BLOCKS
[   START OF BLOCK SCOPE. INSIDE THE BRACKETS ARE ALL BLOCKS
    11. BLOCK0 .FILETYPE STARTROW, ENDROW
    12. BLOCK1 .FILETYPE STARTROW, ENDROW

]   FROM THIS POINT ONWARDS, THE PROGRAM KNOWS IS ALL BLOCKS
